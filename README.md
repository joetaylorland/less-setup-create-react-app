# Using LESS with React

Run ```npm install``` then ```npm start```.

The sample app will run at localhost:4400. The folder styles/styles.less is the master LESS file that is compiled to the necessary css file for index.js. Import your component LESS files here and everything will be auto-compiled as you make changes.
